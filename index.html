                <p>Hello, I'm Gabbi Stein! While my full and legal name is actually Gabriella, I prefer to go by Gabbi.
                    I currently live in Mukilteo, Washington, after moving up this last year from Salt Lake City, UT.
                </p><br>

                <p>At the moment, I am working as a Legal Receptionist / Administrative Assitant for a law firm in
                    Edmonds, Washington. I am the sole point of contact for all phone calls, and I serve as the first
                    line of greeting for all phone calls and in-person client interactions. I also handle various
                    administartive duties for the firm including making and organizing files, ordering supplies,
                    completing reports, sorting mail, and so on. As a person who likes people, I very much enjoy the
                    personal interactions I experience each day.</p><br>

                <p>Outside of work I prefer to explore, whether it be through a novel, video game, or long walk. I am
                    very much into video games and their surrounding culture, and I have found many of my experiences
                    while playing to be some of the strongest connections I've had to any form of media. I also like to
                    try new restaurants, and spend a lot of time on Yelp looking for new Thai or Italian places to try.
                </p><br>
