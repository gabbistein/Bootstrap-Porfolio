                <p>Greetings, I'm Gabbi! Though my full name is actually Gabriella, I prefer to go by Gabbi. I currently
                    live in Mukilteo, Washington after moving to the area from Salt Lake City in August of last year.
                </p><br>

                <p>At the moment, I serve as a Legal Receptionist and Administrative Assitant for a law firm in Edmonds,
                    Washington. I am the first point of contact for all incoming phone calls and in-office client
                    interactions. I also handle administartive duties for the firm including the creation and
                    organization of physical and electronic files, generating reports, sorting mail, directing potential
                    new clients, etc. As a person who likes people, I very much enjoy the interactions I experience each
                    day at work.</p><br>

                <p>When I'm not at work, I like to explore the world around me—whether it be through a novel, video
                    game, or long walk. I am very interested in video games and their surrounding culture, and many of
                    my experiences while playing them have been the strongest connections I've had to any form of media.
                    I'm also a fan of trying new restaurants and I spend a lot of my time looking for new places to try.
                </p>
