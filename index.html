                        <p>Hello, I'm Gabbi Stein! While my full and legal name is actually Gabriella, I prefer to go by Gabbi. I currently live in Mukilteo, Washington, after moving up this last year from Salt Lake City, UT.</p><br>

                        <p>At the moment, I am working as a Legal Receptionist / Administrative Assitant for a law firm in Edmonds, Washington. I am the sole point of contact for all phone calls, and I serve as the first line of greeting for all phone calls and in-person client interactions. I also handle various administartive duties for the firm including making and organizing files, ordering supplies, completing reports, sorting mail, and so on. As a person who likes people, I very much enjoy the personal interactions I experience each day.</p><br>
                            
                        <p>Outside of work I prefer to explore, whether it be through a novel, video game, or long walk. I am very much into video games and their surrounding culture, and I have found many of my experiences while playing to be some of the strongest connections I've had to any form of media. I also like to try new restaurants, and spend a lot of time on Yelp looking for new Thai or Italian places to try.</p><br>
